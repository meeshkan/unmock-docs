#### Why build yet another mocking library?

See [comparison to existing tools](comparison.md).

#### Why is it called unmock if it's a mocking library?

The long-term mission at [unmock.io](https://unmock.io) is to provide a functionally adequate mock of the internet, so you don't have to mock. This mocking library is a side-product of that.

#### Can I record requests and mocks?

Not yet, but soon you can! Please add feature requests in [GitHub](https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js).
